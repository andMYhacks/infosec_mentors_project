        <p>
            The InfoSec Mentors Project was developed as a platform to help individuals more easily obtain (and provide) mentorship
            within the Security Community. If you want to contribute to the project, or start up your own
            mentorship community, check out our codebase on
            <a href="https://github.com/andMYhacks/infosec_mentors_project" target="_blank">Github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was inspired by the original "InfoSec Mentors Project", which existed briefly between 2009 and 2012 thanks to the efforts of
            <a href="https://www.twitter.com/dewzi" target="_blank">Marisa Fagan</a> and
            <a href="https://www.twitter.com/wimremes" target="_blank">Wim Remes</a>
            (among others). We thank them for all of their hard work, and for sharing with the community the value of mentorship.

            <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JimmyVo" target="_blank">@JimmyVo</a> )</b></section><br/>
            In 2009, Jimmy started his InfoSec journey with the help of the original "InfoSec Mentors Project".
            Through InfoSec Mentors, Jimmy was connected with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/helkhoury" target="_blank">Hadi</a>,
            who helped him navigate professional life while finishing up his B.S in Computer Information Systems. <br/><br/>

            Jimmy started out in various help desk roles before transitioning into the world of IT Operations.
            It wasn't long after that he made a full transition into what has become several security roles.
            He has dabbled in Red and Blue teaming, and currently works at a Fortune 50 financial institution as part of
            their security team. When he isn't crushing the dreams of threat actors, he's training in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,
            lifting weights, and petting dogs.

            <a href="https://www.twitter.com/andMYhacks" target="_blank">@andMYhacks</a> )</b></section><br/>
            Keith started down the path of Information Security in the mid-90's as a kid playing Blizzard's popular PC
            title, "Diablo". During that time he learned how to use Telnet to spoof multiple connections to Blizzard's online
            platform "Battle.net" using unauthenticated Diablo trial accounts; it wasn't long before he became hooked on text user interfaces and
            networking protocols. <br/><br/>

            Keith graduated with a B.A. in Psychology in 2009, and worked odd-jobs to support his wife while she pursued her Master's Degree
            during the recession. He recently attended classes in Computer Science at University of New Hampshire, and briefly worked
            for a small Managed Security Services Provider where he earned his Splunk Architect certification. <br/><br/>

            Keith is currently an Engineer on the Customer Success team at Rapid7, and is in the process of learning Web Application Development
            and Security from his mentor, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/CaseyDunham" target="_blank">Casey Dunham</a>.
