###The InfoSec Mentors Project - going Open Source on 03/09/2017
Building a community for those that both seek out and provide mentorship in
Information Security.

###Mission Statement:
It is the mission of the InfoSec Mentors Project to provide a platform through
which individuals might more easily obtain, and provide, mentorship within the
Information Security community. Our goal is to help connect those seeking to
develop new skills with those willing to share their experience. To that end,
we ask that members of our community be open to both obtaining and providing 
mentorship when registering to use the platform we have built. It is our sincere
hope that all those who participate in this community obtain as much wisdom as
can be found - while also sharing that wisdom with others.
